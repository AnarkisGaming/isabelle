[![Build](https://github.com/AnarkisGaming/isabelle/workflows/Build/badge.svg?event=push)](https://github.com/AnarkisGaming/isabelle/actions) ![Publish Docker image](https://github.com/AnarkisGaming/isabelle/workflows/Publish%20Docker%20image/badge.svg)

## Set up

### Natively
If you are using Go 1.15+, download it using `go get` (this will place the executable in `$GOBIN`):

```
GO111MODULE=on go get -u get.cutie.cafe/isabelle
```

Otherwise, you should be able to use a [stable release](https://github.com/AnarkisGaming/isabelle/releases) or [development release](https://github.com/AnarkisGaming/isabelle/actions). If you're using ancient versions of Linux, you may have to build the app yourself (see below).

Then, download config.json.example and move it to config.json. Fill out all of the fields. After, you can just run `isabelle.exe` or `./isabelle`.

### via Docker
Download config.json.example, rename it to config.json, and fill out all of the fields. Then:

```
docker run -it -v /path/to/config.json:/app/config.json -d anarkisgaming/isabelle
```

### via `ops`
A sample `ops.json` file is provided. Install isabelle, make sure you have a valid `config.json` and then:

```
ops run -n ~/go/bin/isabelle -c ops.json
```

## Building
Clone the repository and then run `GO111MODULE=on go build` to install dependencies and build.
