# Isabelle
Accept app crash ZIPs via Discord or e-mail and post them as Discord messages and GitHub issues

[![Build](https://github.com/AnarkisGaming/isabelle/workflows/Build/badge.svg?event=push)](https://github.com/AnarkisGaming/isabelle/actions)

## Set up
If you are using Go 1.14+, download it using `go get` (this will place the executable in `$GOBIN`):

```
GO111MODULE=on go get -u get.cutie.cafe/isabelle
```

Otherwise, you should be able to use a [stable release](https://github.com/AnarkisGaming/isabelle/releases) or [development release](https://github.com/AnarkisGaming/isabelle/actions). If you're using ancient versions of Linux, you may have to build the app yourself (see below).

Then, download config.json.example and move it to config.json. Fill out all of the fields. After, you can just run `isabelle.exe` or `./isabelle`.

## Advanced/extra steps
We're dealing with a lot of user-generated content here, so maaaaybe you should run Isabelle inside something like [ops](https://ops.city) or Docker just in case. A sample `ops.json` file has been included. Use it like this:

```
ops run -n ~/go/bin/isabelle -c ops.json
```

## Building
Clone the repository and then run `go build -i` to install dependencies and build.
